## 📖 Project Experience

**Flying High** was created during a **game jam** with an interdimensional theme. Inspired by the prompt, I came up with a light-hearted concept featuring a **hippie protagonist** who embarks on a trippy journey to another dimension—powered by his trusty bong.

Through this project, I:
- Learned the end-to-end process of building a game under time constraints
- Developed a unique visual style and theme inspired by psychedelic art
- Strengthened my skills in **Unity**, **C# scripting**, and level design in 2d

This game jam was a fun and valuable learning experience that encouraged creativity and quick decision-making, while allowing me to explore storytelling in a more humorous and imaginative way.

Enjoy exploring the project! 🎮🌈☁️
